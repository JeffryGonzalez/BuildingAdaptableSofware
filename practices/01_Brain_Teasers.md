# Brain Teasers

The first practice is a non-coding example (though you may want to actually enter these into Visual Studio so you can step through them with the debugger.)

Jon Skeet (the author of your book) has a few C# brain teasers on his website [http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/teasers.html](http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/teasers.html "Brain Teasers").

Review them, try to figure them out. There is a link to the answers. Try to understand what is going on with each.
