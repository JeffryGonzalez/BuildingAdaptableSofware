Building Adaptable Software
========================

This repository is created for the students of the Building Adaptable Software with C# course.

The `practices` folder contains (or will contain) practice exercises to work on between the two sessions of the course.

Shortly before we meet again, I will put solutions to those practices in the `solutions` folder.

Please try to accomplish as much of the practices as you are able, especially if you aren't able to work in C# and Visual Studio during your day-to-day job. I want us to be able to pick right up where we left off the next time we meet. That will depend largely on how much you retain from this course, which includes not only the concepts but your ability to work effectively in Visual Studio and write code.

Thanks! Looking forward to seeing you all again.

Jeff
